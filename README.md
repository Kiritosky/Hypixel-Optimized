# Hypixel Optimized: The Ultimate Skyblock Experience

Welcome to Hypixel Optimized, your all-in-one solution for conquering Hypixel Skyblock. Whether you are grinding dungeons, farming zealots, or optimizing your minions, this pack provides the perfect balance of essential utilities, extreme performance, and stunning visuals.

Stop wasting time configuring individual mods. We've curated the most powerful tools available and fine-tuned them so you can jump straight into the action with higher FPS and better features.

## ⚡ Essential Hypixel Utilities
This pack is built around the heavy hitters of the Skyblock community. We include the latest versions of mods that give you the competitive edge:

SkyHanni: The definitive utility mod for modern Skyblock, packed with features for every skill and island type.

Skyblocker: Essential tweaks and fixes specifically designed for the Hypixel environment.

NoFrills: A lightweight addition that cuts out the clutter, keeping your interface clean and functional.

## 🚀 Extreme Performance
Lag is the enemy of efficiency. We utilize the modern Fabric ecosystem to ensure your game runs smoother than ever before, even in crowded lobbies:

Sodium: The gold standard for rendering optimization, providing massive FPS boosts.

Lithium & FerriteCore: Backend optimizations that reduce server lag and memory usage.

Entity Culling: Stops the game from rendering things you can't see, saving valuable resources during dungeon runs.

## ✨ Visuals & Quality of Life
Performance doesn't mean your game has to look bad. We’ve added aesthetic improvements that make the blocky world feel alive without tanking your frame rate:

Iris Shaders: Full shader support built-in. Just drag and drop your favorite shader pack and enjoy the view.

3D Skin Layers: Adds depth to player skins for a more polished look.

Resource Pack Support: Fully compatible with popular Skyblock texture packs (like FurfSky Reborn or PacksHQ).

## 🛠️ Ready Out of the Box
The best feature of this modpack is the setup. We include Pre-Made Configs optimized for the average user. Keybinds are sensible, conflicting settings are resolved, and the UI is organized to prevent HUD clutter right from the first launch.
